Updated: 25/11/2019

**Note:** This is a beta version. Some important features and compatibility with some data formats and builds will be surely missing, but will be implemented in future versions

**File requirements**

* TSV, CSV, TXT or compressed (i.e. GZ) formats.

* In hg19/GRCh37 build.

* First line must include, at least: CHR (Chromosome), POS (Base position), REF (Reference allele), ALT (Alternative, or effect allele), SE (Standard Error), P (P-value) and either OR (Odds Ratio) or BETA. If OR is provided, BETA will be calculated automatically.
